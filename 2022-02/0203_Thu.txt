Talk about Your Study Habits


Everyone has their own unique study habits. When I study, I need to clear my desk to concentrate. Sometimes, when I look at my hands after I have been hard at work for a while, I see I have chewed on my hangnails. I do this without thinking about it. I also often talk to myself when I study, or jot down notes while watching lectures. 


My study habits usually pop up when I learn something new or discover something that piques my interest. It’s because I have tunnel vision on days when I’m studying effectively, scribbling notes with my pencil. 


Sometimes, I get curious about other people’s study habits. I also wonder about the habits of older people, since I’m still a young student.
