Talk about Various Types of Side Dish Stores


These days, I prepare three squares a day on over half the days in a month. That’s why I’ve been making repeat visits to our neighborhood side dish stores really often. 


There is a wide variety of side dish stores in our neighborhood. Some of them are branches of major chains, but others are local mom and pop stores. The side dishes of the day are popular at the self owned stores. The day’s menu is posted on BAND at around 2 PM. Customers leave comments with the numbers and types of side dishes they want. Then, they go to pick up their purchases. It’s great not having to worry about what to eat, since there are new dishes every day. 


These days, there are also unmanned stores where you can buy meal kits around the clock. While I am grateful for all the side dish stores where I conveniently shop for food, I’m a little worried about the excessive use of plastic containers.
