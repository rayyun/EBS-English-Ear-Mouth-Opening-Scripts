Talk about Your Experience of Writing with Your Child


I wanted to teach my kid that it’s possible to express his thoughts and emotions in writing. That’s why I started a ‘Writing your thoughts for 15 minutes’ activity with him. We’ve maintained the routine for several years, starting in the early years of grade school. 


First, my son comes up with a topic to write about. Then, we set a timer for 15 minutes. During that time, he writes about the topic he chose. It’s less of a burden for him since he’s writing about a fun topic of his own choosing. 


In earlier grades, writing his thoughts was an effective way to practice spelling and word spacing. It also helped him overcome the pressure he felt about writing. Later on in higher grades, writing his thoughts helped my son express himself logically. It also expanded his vocabulary, improving his ability to express himself in writing.
