Talk about Pigeons


Pigeons are common birds that can be found almost anywhere. They have an average lifespan of 10 to 20 years. Pigeons became a symbol of peace when the UN adopted a dove design after World War II. Since the 20th century, pigeons have enjoyed a popular image, as fixtures in magic shows and various literary works. 


However, pigeons have recently become a major headache. Because of the explosive growth of pigeon populations in urban areas, they are treated like pests. Pigeons’ droppings are highly corrosive, and there have been multiple reports of the guano causing property damage. 


Pigeons are smarter than people give them credit for. It’s no surprise that they are so adaptable to urban environments. By maintaining their population at an appropriate level, I hope they will be loved once again as a symbol of peace.
