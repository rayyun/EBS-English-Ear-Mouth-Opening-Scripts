Talk about Your Child’s Fiancee


My son lives on his own and goes to work far from his childhood home. I didn’t even know that he was seeing someone. One day, he said that he wanted to introduce us to his girlfriend, whom he wanted to tie the knot with. The news came out of the blue for us. 


We felt hurt that he had kept his private life under wraps like that. We were also a bit nervous.   But soon, our emotions turned to curiosity and a sense of anticipation. My husband and I had a lot on our mind, and we had trouble sleeping all week. 


Feeling nervous, we met our son’s significant other. To our great relief, we had a good feeling about her. You could say we felt a connection to her. We also felt as if we had matured further as well.
