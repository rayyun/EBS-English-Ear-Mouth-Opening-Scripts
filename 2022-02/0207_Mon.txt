Describe a Time When You Received Dental Treatment


People always say you shouldn’t postpone going to the dentist. It’s because putting off treatment will result in more pain and higher costs. 


A while ago, I felt some pain in my left upper molar. I went to the dentist’s, but they said nothing was wrong each time. Then, during a dental checkup a few years later, they found a cavity in the gap between the two upper molars on the left. It was a bad cavity, and they said I needed a root canal. 


I had to go every week for a month to get treatment. The first two times, I was in agony even though they gave me a local anesthetic. I needed to take painkillers after the treatment. The doctor made a mold of my tooth at the end of my treatment, and a week later I got a dental crown.
