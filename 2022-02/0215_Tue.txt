Talk about English Kindergartens


Kids in Korea can begin attending kindergarten at 5 years old. Many parents these days are sending their kids off to English Kindergartens. 


These places are called kindergartens out of convenience, but in reality, they are actually a type of private educational institute for English. Kids can level up their English skills since classes are held in English all day with teachers who are native speakers. But this can be taxing on young children. Another problem is the tuition fees, which can border on excessive. 


My daughter turns 5 years old this year, and I’m torn over whether to send her to an English kindergarten. I’ve read various opinions online, but the effectiveness and adjustment period are all over the place depending on the child. This has made it even harder to make the call.
