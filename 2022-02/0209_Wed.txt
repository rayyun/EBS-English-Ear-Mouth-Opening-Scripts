Talk about How to Enjoy Wine


I enjoy wine from time to time. There is some basic knowledge about wine that often comes in handy. Don’t raise your glass when someone pours wine for you. If you feel self-conscious to just look on, you can place your hand on the base of the glass. When pouring wine, filling the glass a third of the way is about right. When you clink glasses to drink a toast, you should tilt the glass about 15 degrees and lightly tap the bowls together. Higher-end glasses will make a clearer sound. 


You should hold a wine glass by its stem. This is to prevent changing the wine’s flavor with your body heat. Chugging down wine is a no-no. You should gently swirl your glass, taking in the wine’s aroma and flavor as you sip slowly. You can eat some plain white bread, crackers, or cheese when you switch to a different type of wine. This is meant to cleanse your palate and wash away the flavor of the previous wine.
