Talk about Your Personality


My husband and I are both quick-tempered and impatient. When we go to check out at the supermarket, we walk up and down looking for the shortest line. We sigh impatiently if the person in front of us takes a long time to collect loyalty points. 


Even when we visit famous restaurants, we leave if there’s a long wait. We get very frustrated if we are stuck at a light or if a bus moves at a sluggish pace. We can get a lot done thanks to our impatience at the office, but that also means we have a heavier workload than others. 


We are both aware that this kind of personality isn’t all that good. We’ve tried to change our ways, but we’re so busy that it’s not easy. Still, we will have to make a conscious effort to take it easy with little things, to ensure better mental health.
