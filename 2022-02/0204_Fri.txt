Talk about Your Experience with Yoga


I have been practicing yoga for about five years. When I first got into it, I couldn’t even do the most basic, simple leg stretches. I was in agony during every class. Still, I didn’t call it quits. I constantly braced myself and continued to practice hard. I straightened my upper body as a result, fixing my hunched over posture. I also strengthened my core and successfully lost weight. 


Yoga also helped me recover my mental health. I achieved this through yoga meditation. Turning on soothing Indian yoga meditation music and taking time for introspection was a valuable experience. Inner peace through yoga has become a gift that keeps on giving. 


At the age of thirty, I became certified as a yoga instructor. I am grateful for my current job and my job satisfaction is high, but someday I would like to have a side job teaching yoga.
