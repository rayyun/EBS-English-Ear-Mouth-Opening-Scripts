So, what should you do if you lose your credit card? Well, whatever you do, time is of the essence. Take action before a fraud </span><span>stream</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>makes </span><span>you </span><span>for all </span><span>you&rsquo;re</span><span>&nbsp;worth</span><span>. Here are five steps to take if your credit card is lost or stolen. First, call your credit card issuer immediately to report the loss or theft. Normally, you </span><span>could </span><span>find the contact number on the back of your card. But, because your card is missing, that&rsquo;s obviously no longer a </span><span>viable</span><span>&nbsp;option. Nevertheless, don&rsquo;t panic. You can find your credit card issuer&rsquo;s phone number on your credit card statement or online. Your credit card issuer will first verify your identity. To do so, you&rsquo;ll likely need to supply information such as your name, address or pin. It will help if you know when your card was lost or stolen. They may review recent transactions to see if any of them appear to be </span><span>fraudulent</span><span class="c2">. After that, your issuer will cancel your account and mail you a new card with a new number. And the old days, that will be that. But today, because of mobile payments, there&rsquo;s one more step. Make sure to update your mobile wallet on your phone with your new number. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&#51077;&#51060; &#53944;&#51060;&#45716; &#50689;&#50612;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Tuesday, September 7th</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5 c6">Talk about When You Lost Your Credit Card </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I was on my way home on the subway. My phone was vibrating, but I couldn&rsquo;t pick up the phone because I was on a train. Then, I got a long text informing me that a theft or loss report had been filed for my credit card. Startled, I checked my phone case. My credit card wasn&rsquo;t in </span><span>its</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;slot. The card slot had become loose. My card must have slipped out. I called a credit card company and asked what had happened. They told me which station my card was at, so I went to the Lost and Found there. After a quick ID check, I was able to get my card back. I called a credit card company right away and canceled the theft or loss report. It took an hour from finding out I had lost my card to getting it back again. I feel grateful to whomever found my card and handed it over to the customer center, the employees at the Lost and Found, and the credit card company. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">Dialogue Practice</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A : I lost my wallet yesterday. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">B : Oh, no.
