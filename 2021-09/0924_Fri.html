Hallasan (&#54620;&#46972;&#49328;)</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Mt. Hallasan is within Hallasan National Park on South Korea&rsquo;s magnificent Jeju Island. Some people consider it to be a volcano. However, many scientists feel that its lack of activity means it should be classified as </span><span class="c4">dormant</span><span class="c4">. Regardless, Mt. Hallasan provides hikers with the best way of seeing all of Jeju Island from one place. There are four main trails on Mt. Hallasan. However, only two of these will take hikers all the way to the tip of the mountain&rsquo;s volcanic crater. These are the Gwaneumsa(&#44288;&#51020;&#49324;) Trail and the </span><span class="c4">Seongpanak</span><span class="c4">(&#49457;&#54032;&#50501;</span><span class="c4">) Trail. Despite its extra 900 meters in length, the </span><span class="c4">Seongpanak</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;trail&rsquo;s milder incline makes it the more popular of the two. However, the Gwaneumsa Trail is the most picturesque. Some trails like the Eorimok(&#50612;&#47532;&#47785;) Trail and the Yeongsil(&#50689;&#49892;) Trail can be hiked in as little as two hours. Nevertheless, hikers are advised not to leave their starting time too late. Doing so can cause slower hikers to become </span><span class="c4">stranded</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;overnight. Therefore to ensure sufficient time to get up and back down during daylight hours. Park officials have instituted cut-off times that vary with the seasons. In most seasons, starting before noon will </span><span class="c4">suffice</span><span class="c6 c4">. However, in the summer months, starts can be delayed until 1:00 PM. Realistically, however, earlier start times are recommended. In the winter this can mean starting as early as 9:00 AM, and in the summer hikers can wait until 10:00 AM to start.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c6 c4"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c6 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c8">&#51077;&#51060; &#53944;&#51060;&#45716; &#50689;&#50612;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c8">Friday, September 24th</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Talk about a Day Trip to Hallasan Mountain</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c6 c7"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c4">On weekends I often go hiking in the mountains near my house. One day, I started to think about climbing Hallasan Mountain on Jeju Island. I searched online to find out whether I could do it as a day trip. The first order of business to visit Baengnokdam(&#48177;&#47197;&#45812;) Crater Lake at the mountain top is to make a reservation. Because of COVID-19, the number of visitors each day is limited to 1500. Upon arriving at Jeju Airport on the first available flight, I went to the hiking information center. I checked in with the QR code I was given through the reservation system and started my hike. Hearing the birds singing and taking in the fresh air, I felt refreshed. I finally arrived at Baengnokdam at Hallasan Mountain&rsquo;s peak. Even though it was a weekday, people were waiting in line to take pictures. After descending the mountain, I went back to the airport, hopped on a plane, and went home. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dialogue Practice</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">A: Day trips to Hallasan Mountain </span><span class="c4">are all the rage</span><span class="c6 c4">&nbsp;these days. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c4">B: Really?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c6 c4">A: Yes.
