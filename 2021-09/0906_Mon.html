However, because they are not quite as well known as cats and dogs, raising a guinea pig can require a bit of specialized knowledge. From </span><span>the</span><span>&nbsp;expected life span to the social nature of guinea pigs here are some things to consider before choosing a guinea pig as a pet. While guinea pigs don&rsquo;t live nearly as long as cats or dogs </span><span>there are still </span><span>a large of</span><span>&nbsp;time commitment</span><span>. Guinea pigs live around 5 to 7 years on average. But sometimes longer. Also, &nbsp;guinea pigs are very social animals and are at their happiest living with other guinea pigs. Guinea pigs need a lot of room. Most cages that are marketed as guinea pig cages are too small. But the good news is making a homemade cage is easy. And since guinea pigs are not </span><span>prone to</span><span>&nbsp;running away, a homemade cage is a great option. On the health front, guinea pigs are one of the few animals that cannot manufacture vitamin C. That means, that they </span><span>mu</span><span>st</span><span>&nbsp;get it from their foods. Incidentally, the same </span><span>is</span><span>&nbsp;true</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of humans. Choosing good quality food and providing a variety of fresh foods are indeed important. But just to be safe, many guinea pig owners give their pets a vitamin C supplement. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&#51077;&#51060; &#53944;&#51060;&#45716; &#50689;&#50612;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Monday, September 6th </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Talk about Guinea Pigs</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Guinea pigs are </span><span>rodents</span><span>&nbsp;that are very popular as pets. They have a gentle </span><span>disposition</span><span>. And adorable doll-like faces. Their </span><span>plum</span><span>p rear ends make them </span><span>look</span><span>&nbsp;similar to pigs which is why they were given that name. Guinea pigs scare easily and they are sensitive. But they </span><span>take to</span><span>&nbsp;people surprisingly well. They recognize their family&rsquo;s voices and smells of food. They also </span><span>recognized</span><span>&nbsp;their own name. Sometimes, they beg for food. They are also quite </span><span>clever</span><span>. And</span><span>&nbsp;can be</span><span>&nbsp;tout and</span><span>&nbsp;tricks</span><span>. Because of their digestive system, guinea pigs eat all day long. If they remain on an empty stomach for too long, they might die. To raise a healthy guinea pig, you have to pay close attention to their food. They require an unlimited supply of fresh water and hay. You should also feed them pet food and fresh </span><span>produce </span><span class="c1">to supplement nutrients. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Dialogue Practice</span></p><p class="c2"><span>A: </span><span class="c1">Did you say you have a pet guinea pig at home?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">B: That&rsquo;s right.
