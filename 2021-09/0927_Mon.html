Courier services, however, actually </span><span>saw</span><span>&nbsp;a surge in popularity. Prior to the pandemic, people used couriers about six times per month on average. But during the pandemic, that number </span><span>rose</span><span>&nbsp;to nearly ten. People in their twenties accounted for the highest growth jumping from just over five deliveries per month to nearly ten. Interestingly, people in their seventies saw the second-largest growth. Their delivery use increased from almost exactly five times per month to just over eight. Some researchers attributed these increases to two main factors. First, the fact that more universities began to offer online classes. And second, the fact that older people who are at higher risk tended to avoid danger. When broken down by </span><span>items</span><span>, food </span><span>saw </span><span>the biggest jump </span><span>in</span><span>&nbsp;deliveries</span><span>, up</span><span>&nbsp;nearly 84% from the pre-pandemic levels. Next on the list were books, home appliances, and household goods. As people </span><span>spent</span><span>&nbsp;more time at home</span><span>, </span><span>there were fewer outdoor activities. At the same time, demand for daily necessities increased. At current growth </span><span>rate</span><span>s, Korea&rsquo;s </span><span>parcel</span><span>&nbsp;delivery volume is expected to reach more than 5 and </span><span>a</span><span>&nbsp;half billion boxes by late 2023. That </span><span>staggering</span><span>&nbsp;number is double that of 2019. Despite this strong growth, Korea&rsquo;s parcel delivery industry is said to face some </span><span>ongoing </span><span>challenges. </span><span>Two </span><span>major ones are lack of supply logistic</span><span>s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;facilities and worsening labor conditions.</span></p><p class="c9 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#51077;&#51060; &#53944;&#51060;&#45716; &#50689;&#50612; </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Monday, September 27th </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Talk about Parcel Distribution Centers</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>I started a part-time job at </span><span>a</span><span>&nbsp;distribution center for a parcel delivery </span><span>company back in May. On</span><span>&nbsp;my first day, I was worried that it would be a </span><span>tough grind</span><span>. I wasn&rsquo;t wrong. Parcels to be delivered to homes and to large-scale supermarkets, shopping malls, and department stores are dealt with separately at the Distribution Center. I was assigned to the </span><span>latter</span><span class="c0">. The goods were packaged in large boxes and they weighed an average of at least 10 kilograms. I was in charge of sorting parcels on a conveyor belt depending on where they are going to be delivered. I did the sorting work for about 4 hours a day, starting at 7 o&rsquo;clock in the morning. After the sorting was finished, the parcels were loaded onto delivery trucks. Then, the parcel delivery workers got to work delivering them to their designated areas. The part-time job helped me experience firsthand all the hard work done by their delivery workers.</span></p><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8">Dialogue Practice</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A: Parcel deliveries in Korea are something else.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>B: That&rsquo;s right.
