And this sense of so-called, &lsquo;subjective age&rsquo; can have significant impacts on people&rsquo;s physical and mental health. So, how old are you? Think about it without considering the year you were born. Instead, answer the question based on the way you feel. In other words, how old do you feel? Scientists have found that how people answer that question can explain why some people appear to flourish as </span><span>they </span><span>age, while others fade. When older people claim to feel younger than they are, it can influence their life choices in a positive way. The opposite is also true. Thinking that you are older than you actually are, can affect you negatively. Several studies have even shown that your subjective age can predict various important health outcomes including your risk of death. So</span><span>&nbsp;it </span><span>stands</span><span>&nbsp;to reason</span><span>&nbsp;that t</span><span>he old </span><span>adage</span><span>,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re only as old as you feel.&rdquo; may actually be true. So with these results in hand, scientists are trying to identify the many factors that shape people&rsquo;s experience of aging. The hope is that this knowledge might help people not only live longer lives but also healthier ones.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span class="c1">&#51077;&#51060; &#53944;&#51060;&#45716; &#50689;&#50612; </span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span class="c1">Monday, September 20th &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c7 c0"><span class="c4">Talk about When You Feel like You Are Getting Older</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Entering a new decade of my life gave me mixed feelings. I&rsquo;ve only turned forty years old, but I feel ancient. My social responsibility seems like it has more than doubled, too. I was </span><span>dismayed</span><span>&nbsp;to find that I am not like I was in my twenties, no matter how well I put on makeup or </span><span>strike a pose</span><span>. I don&rsquo;t have the </span><span>supple</span><span>&nbsp;skin that I used to, and it has no </span><span>pep</span><span class="c1">. When I was a twenty-something, I didn&rsquo;t know that youth would be short-lived and brilliant. I am working out, but my body shape is becoming rounder. I feel sad that I am turning old like this. I should learn to love my middle-aged appearance for what it is, but it still feels unfamiliar. I would like to become a person who is beautiful both inside and out as I get older. Now, I have to aim for a more mature appeal.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c4">Dialogue Practice</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A: I feel like I&rsquo;m getting old.
