Therefore, getting a parrot is a long term commitment that should not be taken lightly. Parrots require a great deal of social activity and attention. So if you don&rsquo;t have a lot of spare time, they might not be the right pet for you. Like other birds, parrots have a high degree of intelligence. Studies have shown that parrots have advanced abilities to problem solve and communicate. They can even understand concepts like math, shapes and colors. In fact, it&rsquo;s been estimated that parrots have the same intelligence levels and reasoning skills as a 7 </span><span>year-old</span><span>&nbsp;child. Unlike other animals, parrots don&rsquo;t require much </span><span>grooming</span><span>. Instead, they will do most of the work themselves. Parrots are naturally hygienic animals who </span><span>preen</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;their feathers on a daily basis. Preening is just another way of saying grooming. It&rsquo;s the method that birds use to remove dust, dirt, and parasites from their feathers. When people think about affectionate pets, parrots aren&rsquo;t usually the first thing that comes to mind. But the truth is, parrots are actually very social animals. In fact, parrots that don&rsquo;t get enough attention can develop behavioral issues. This is why it is so important that people who own parrots have plenty of spare time to dedicate to them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&#51077;&#51060; &#53944;&#51060;&#45716; &#50689;&#50612;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday, September 15th </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Talk about Pet Parrots</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Personal expression is very important these days. So there is a wide variety of companion animals. Among them, parrots are </span><span>catching on</span><span>&nbsp;as popular pet birds. Raising a parrot at home can feel unfamiliar at first. But a surprisingly large number of households are doing just that. I have two pet parrots at home. Raising parrots comes with a lot of perks. Unlike dogs or cats, they don&rsquo;t shed fur. So they won&rsquo;t trigger your allergies. Also, there&rsquo;s no need to walk them. They are quite healthy without any </span><span>niggling </span><span>illnesses and they don&rsquo;t need to get shots. Most of all, parrots are as </span><span>obedient</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and affectionate as dogs. They are highly intelligent, so you can train them to do tricks.
